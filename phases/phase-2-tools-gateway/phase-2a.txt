Phase 2a – SA Pro tutor with calculator tool (Strands)

Main Python file for this phase:
phases/phase-2-tools-gateway/sa_pro_tutor_tools_2a.py

Purpose of this phase:
Extend the basic Phase 1 SA Pro tutor with a calculator tool for precise numeric reasoning.

Keep the same request/response contract as Phase 1:
Input: {"prompt": "<user question>"}
Output: {"result": "<answer as plain text>"}

What’s new vs Phase 1:

Uses strands_tools.calculator so the agent can reliably handle cost/throughput math (e.g., data transfer, storage, RPS calculations).

System prompt instructs the tutor to:

Use the calculator for numeric questions.

Show step-by-step reasoning.

Explain implications in SA Pro exam terms (trade-offs, patterns, best practices).

How to run this phase:
-----------------------
Ensure AWS_PROFILE and AWS_REGION (us-east-1) are set in the shell.

From the phase-2 folder:

1. agentcore configure -n sa_pro_tutor_2a -e sa_pro_tutor_tools_2a.py

2. agentcore launch

3. agentcore invoke '{ "prompt": "Estimate monthly data transfer cost for 3 TB per month between two Regions and explain the trade-offs." }'
